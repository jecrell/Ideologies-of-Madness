    <description>The ideoligion is convinced that the true forces that guide the cosmos are unknowable and terrifying, and worst of all, uncaring of human life. Whether the adherents of this ideoligion attempt to appease, hide from, or oppose the Things That Dwell Beyond, central to this belief system is the insignificance of mankind in the larger universe.</description>
